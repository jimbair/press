This document contains some technical debt items.
It may also detail some of our aspirations which were too lofty.

* standardize press system configuration (not user configuration)
    * Find logging, path, and other configurations in
        - /etc/press
        - ./.press
        - ~/.press
        - if a directory called plugins is found, it should be scanned for plugins
* fsck options and mount options are hacks.
* code duplication between Partition and LogicalVolume, create a base class
   and make it work.
* Define configuration requirements and check for them before running generators
